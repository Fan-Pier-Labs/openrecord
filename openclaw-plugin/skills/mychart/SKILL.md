## Guidelines

- **Session management is automatic.** The plugin logs in automatically using saved credentials and TOTP. You do not need to manage sessions.
- If a tool returns an error about credentials, tell the user to run `openclaw mychart setup`.
- When presenting **lab results**, include reference ranges and flag abnormal values clearly.
- Present **medications** with dosage, frequency, and prescribing provider when available.
- For **billing data**, summarize totals and highlight outstanding balances.
- When sending messages, always use `mychart_get_message_recipients` and `mychart_get_message_topics` first to get valid values.
- **Never fabricate or assume health data** — only report what the tools return.
- **Be sensitive** — this is personal health information.
- If a tool returns an error, explain the issue clearly and suggest next steps.
